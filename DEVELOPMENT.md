# Developer Readme

This document contains documentation intended for developers of fuzz_lang.

Pre-requisites:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> Note: In order for the pre-commit hooks to function properly, your Docker daemon should be running during setup.

## First time setup
If you're creating fuzz_lang for the first time, you'll need to configure your local development environment along with the remote repository.

You can do this by simply running:

```bash
make -f initial-project-setup.mk project-setup
```

This will install Python `3.12` using PyEnv, create a virtual environment using Poetry, install and update pre-commit hooks, create and push a `develop` branch, and finally, remove the [`initial-project-setup`](initial-project-setup.mk) file.

> Note: the `initial-project-setup` process will check whether `pre-commits`, `pyenv`, and `poetry` are installed. If not, it will ask to install them on your behalf as they're required to use this template.

## Developer environment setup

To work on the fuzz_lang as a developer, you'll need to configure your local development environment. You can do this by simply running:
```bash
make project-setup
```
This will install Python `3.12` using PyEnv, create a virtual environment using Poetry, and install the pre-commit hooks.

> Note: The `project-setup` process will check whether `pre-commits`, `pyenv`, and `poetry` are installed. If not, it will ask to install them on your behalf as they're required to use this template.
> The first time the project is set up, you should follow the instructions in [First time setup](#first-time-setup).


A Makefile is just a usual text file to define a set of rules or instructions to run which can be run using the `make` command. To see the available make commands:
```bash
make help
```

## Testing

With the poetry shell active (see above), you can run all the tests using:

```bash
make tests
```

Or specific tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_dummy.py
```
